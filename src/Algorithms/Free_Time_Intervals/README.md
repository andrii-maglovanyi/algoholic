Two employees have a list of non-overlapping meeting intervals.

Find the list of intervals, representing a common free time.

```
firstPersonMeetings = [["9:00", "10:30"], ["12:00", "13:00"], ["16:00", "18:00"]];

firstPersonDayBounds = ["9:00", "20:00"];

secondPersonMeetings = [["10:00", "11:30"], ["12:30", "14:30"], ["14:30", "15:00"], ["16:00", "17:00"]];

secondPersonDayBounds = ["10:00", "18:30"];

meetingDuration = 30;

output = [["11:30", "12:00"], ["15:00", "16:00"], ["18:00", "18:30"]];
```
