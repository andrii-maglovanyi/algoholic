# A word count that corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text

A function takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a map â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.

Take care of capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:

```
"After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:"
"Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar."
```
