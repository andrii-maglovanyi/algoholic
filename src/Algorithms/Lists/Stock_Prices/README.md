# Stock Buy Sell to maximize profit

The cost of a stock within day is given in an array.

Write an efficient function that takes stockPrices and returns the **best profit possible from one purchase and one sale of one share of stock**.

```javascript
const stockPrices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

getMaxProfit(stockPrices); //6
```
