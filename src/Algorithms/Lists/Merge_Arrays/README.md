# Merge Arrays

Given two sorted arrays of integers. Write a function to merge our arrays of orders into one sorted array.

```javascript
const arrayOne = [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 15];
const arrayTwo = [1, 5, 8, 12, 14, 19];

mergeArrays(arrayOne, arrayTwo); // [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19]
```
