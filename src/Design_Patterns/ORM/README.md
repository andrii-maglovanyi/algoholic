## Active Record

Using the Active Record approach, you define all your query methods inside the model itself, and you save, remove, and load objects using model methods.

Simply said, the Active Record pattern is an approach to access your database within your models.

```javascript
// example how to save AR entity
const user = new User();
user.firstName = "Timber";
user.lastName = "Saw";
user.isActive = true;
await user.save();

// example how to remove AR entity
await user.remove();

// example how to load AR entities
const users = await User.find({ skip: 2, take: 5 });
const newUsers = await User.find({ isActive: true });
const timber = await User.findOne({ firstName: "Timber", lastName: "Saw" });
```

## Data Mapper

Using the Data Mapper approach, you define all your query methods in separate classes called "repositories", and you save, remove, and load objects using repositories. In data mapper your entities are very dumb - they just define their properties and may have some "dummy" methods.

Simply said, data mapper is an approach to access your database within repositories instead of models.

```javascript
const userRepository = connection.getRepository(User);

// example how to save DM entity
const user = new User();
user.firstName = "Timber";
user.lastName = "Saw";
user.isActive = true;
await userRepository.save(user);

// example how to remove DM entity
await userRepository.remove(user);

// example how to load DM entities
const users = await userRepository.find({ skip: 2, take: 5 });
const newUsers = await userRepository.find({ isActive: true });
const timber = await userRepository.findOne({
  firstName: "Timber",
  lastName: "Saw",
});
```

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
