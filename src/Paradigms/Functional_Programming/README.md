# Characteristics of functional Programming

- First-class Functions
- [Higher-order Functions](Higher_Order_Functions/README.md)
- Immutable Data
- Lazy Evaluation
- Manipulation of Lists
- Pure Functions
- Recursion

## Functor

A **functor** represents a set of things that can be mapped over to obtain a set of new things under that same structure.
We use the .map(f) method to perform that mapping.

### Examples

- Array
