# Characteristics of functional Programming

- First-class Functions
- Higher-order Functions
- Pure Functions
- Immutable Data
- Recursion
- Manipulation of Lists
- Lazy Evaluation

## Functor

A **functor** represents a set of things that can be mapped over to obtain a set of new things under that same structure.
We use the .map(f) method to perform that mapping.
