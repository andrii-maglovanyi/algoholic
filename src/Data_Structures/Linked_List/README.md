**Linked lists** are an ordered collection of objects and have constant-time insertions and deletions because we can just change the pointers. To do the same operations in arrays requires linear time because subsequent items need to be shifted over.

Linked lists differ from lists and arrays in the way that they store elements in memory. While lists and arrays use a contiguous memory block to store references to their data, linked lists store references as part of their own elements.
