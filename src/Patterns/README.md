A **design pattern** is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

"Each patterns describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."
